      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>I am currently a server at Longhorn Steakhouse. I am eager to learn more about 
        coding and software development. I look forward to starting my career in the tech industry!</p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>Originally from Florida, I now reside in North Carolina.</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>I love to read in my spare time. I am currently heavy into Haruki Murakami novels.</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>My dream job right now is to become a full stack developer.</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>I live in North Carolina, but hopefully not for too much longer.</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>I want to be a web developer because I love the aspect of constantly learning on the job. 
        I also like the idea of working colloboratively on various projects and seeing changes 
        we make in real time. There is so much more there is for me to learn about web 
        development and I'm sure that will bring to light many more reasons for me to become a developer! :) </p>
